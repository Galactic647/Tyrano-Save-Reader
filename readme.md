Tyrano save file `.sav` data are usually just json stored in an URL encoding or a percent-encoding. For example `@` will be encoded into `%40`.

This tool can convert `.sav` into `.json` and back. This tool also have a monitor function that keep track the changes between the save file and the parsed file, so you can edit the values without touching the save file.
